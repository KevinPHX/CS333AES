For each token t, we extract its uppermost node n in the parse tree with the lexical head t and define a lexico- syntactic feature as the combination of t and the constituent type of n. We also consider the child node of n in the path to t and its right sibling, and combine their lexical heads and constituent types as described by Soricut and Marcu (2003).\"\n",
